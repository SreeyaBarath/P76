        <p>A black hole is a region in space where gravitational force is infinitely stronger compared to any other planet.</p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Black holes are perhaps the most strange and fascinating objects known to exist in the universe. Our understanding of space and time is pushed to its limits by the extreme conditions found in these objects. They can be used as natural laboratories to test the behavior of matter in very strong gravitational fields.</p>

        <h3>How are black holes formed?</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>  
        <p>A black hole can be formed by the death of a massive star. When such a star has exhausted the internal thermonuclear fuels in its core at the end of its life, the core becomes unstable and gravitationally collapses inward upon itself, and the star's outer layers are blown away.</p>
